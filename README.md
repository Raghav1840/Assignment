{this code defines a class called Book. Each book object created using this class has three pieces of information: a unique identification number (book_id), a title (title), and its current status (status). The display_book_details() method allows users to see these details for any given book object. To use the code, simply create a new book instance by providing the required details like ID, title, and status. Then, call the display_book_details() method to print out the information about that book. It's important to make sure that the status provided is accurate (e.g., "borrowed" or "available") to ensure the displayed details are correct. This code is helpful for managing and viewing information about different books in a simple and organized manner}.

Count_toatal_num: https://github.com/Raghav1840/Assignment/commit/01a9f54014c2352c5f8815595ca6c8bd0f8437ab
{the sentence is assigned to a variable named sent. Then, the count() method is used on the sentence string with the argument ' ', which represents a space. This method counts the occurrences of spaces in the sentence, and by adding 1 to this count, we get the total number of words. Finally, the result is printed out}

Replace_text: https://github.com/Raghav1840/Assignment/commit/f3b3352128438f8ba2029819697da6751eb9357f
{code is defines a string variable named test with the value 'i like cat'. Then, the replace() method is called on this string with two arguments: 'cat', the word to be replaced, and 'dog', the word to replace it with. The replace() method substitutes all occurrences of 'cat' with 'dog' in the test string. The resulting string is then printed out. So, the output would be 'i like dog'.}

Turtle_Drawing: https://github.com/Raghav1840/Assignment/commit/6295ea9bf53e82ca365b1b750a8123f9de882c7a 
{code uses a turtle to draw shapes on the screen. First, it creates a turtle named "timmy" and sets its appearance to look like a turtle and its color to purple. Then, it makes "timmy" move forward and turn, repeating this to create a square. After that, it changes the color to yellow and moves "timmy" again to create the top side of the square. Finally, it prints the height of the canvas and waits for the user to click to close the window.}

Turtle2_Drawing: https://github.com/Raghav1840/Assignment/commit/d1f263979547013d2707340257d63507a44598e7
{code uses a turtle named "timmy" to draw a square outline. First, it creates "timmy" and sets its appearance to look like a turtle with a purple color. Then, it defines a function called drawSquare() that tells "timmy" to move forward and turn to create the square outline. After defining the function, it calls it to make "timmy" draw the square. Then, it changes "timmy's" fill color to blue-green and prints the height of the canvas. Finally, it waits for the user to click to close the window.}
