{this code defines a class called Book. Each book object created using this class has three pieces of information: a unique identification number (book_id), a title (title), and its current status (status). The display_book_details() method allows users to see these details for any given book object. To use the code, simply create a new book instance by providing the required details like ID, title, and status. Then, call the display_book_details() method to print out the information about that book. It's important to make sure that the status provided is accurate (e.g., "borrowed" or "available") to ensure the displayed details are correct. This code is helpful for managing and viewing information about different books in a simple and organized manner}.

Count_toatal_num: https://github.com/Raghav1840/Assignment/commit/01a9f54014c2352c5f8815595ca6c8bd0f8437ab
{the sentence is assigned to a variable named sent. Then, the count() method is used on the sentence string with the argument ' ', which represents a space. This method counts the occurrences of spaces in the sentence, and by adding 1 to this count, we get the total number of words. Finally, the result is printed out}

Replace_text: https://github.com/Raghav1840/Assignment/commit/f3b3352128438f8ba2029819697da6751eb9357f
{code is defines a string variable named test with the value 'i like cat'. Then, the replace() method is called on this string with two arguments: 'cat', the word to be replaced, and 'dog', the word to replace it with. The replace() method substitutes all occurrences of 'cat' with 'dog' in the test string. The resulting string is then printed out. So, the output would be 'i like dog'.}

Turtle_Drawing: https://github.com/Raghav1840/Assignment/commit/6295ea9bf53e82ca365b1b750a8123f9de882c7a 
{code uses a turtle to draw shapes on the screen. First, it creates a turtle named "timmy" and sets its appearance to look like a turtle and its color to purple. Then, it makes "timmy" move forward and turn, repeating this to create a square. After that, it changes the color to yellow and moves "timmy" again to create the top side of the square. Finally, it prints the height of the canvas and waits for the user to click to close the window.}

Turtle2_Drawing: https://github.com/Raghav1840/Assignment/blob/main/Turtle2
{code uses a turtle named "timmy" to draw a square outline. First, it creates "timmy" and sets its appearance to look like a turtle with a purple color. Then, it defines a function called drawSquare() that tells "timmy" to move forward and turn to create the square outline. After defining the function, it calls it to make "timmy" draw the square. Then, it changes "timmy's" fill color to blue-green and prints the height of the canvas. Finally, it waits for the user to click to close the window.}

{User Class: Defines the User class with an __init__ method to initialize a user with a user ID and an empty list for borrowed books.
display_user_info Method: Prints the user's ID and the list of borrowed books.
add_book Method: Adds a book to the user's borrowed list.
remove_book Method: Removes a book from the user's borrowed list if it exists in the list; otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the book is not found.

{ the user to input their username and password. Then, it compares these inputs with predefined values: username 'abc' and password 'student'.
Next, it defines a function called check(), which prompts the user again to input their username and password. It checks if these inputs match the predefined values. If both the username and password match, it prints "welcome to college". Otherwise, it prints "unauthorized".}

{This code defines a Book class with attributes like title, author, pages, and price. It has methods to get the price of a book and set a discount on its price. Additionally, there's a function to display book details.A book instance named Book1 is created with information about "Harry Potter" by "J.K Rowling", having 223 pages and priced at $22.50.The code then prints the author, title, and original price of Book1, followed by applying a discount of $6 to the book's price and printing the updated price.It's a simple demonstration of a book object and its functionalities like getting the price and applying discounts.}
